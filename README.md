> Just foolin' around.


Find the official documentation [here](https://dropd.github.io/tryout_nbdev/)

## Install

`pip install tryou`

## How to use

I don't know what you would want to use this for.
It's just a sandbox for learining nbdev. For example, the following should be treated as a usage example

```python
say_hello("nbdev")
```




    'Hello nbdev!'
